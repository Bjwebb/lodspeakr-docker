        <h1>Data Model</h1>        
      </div>
      
      <p>To be able to rapidly iterate on the data model for ResourceProjects.org we have built on a <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">linked data</a> model. Our data is therefore an extensible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)">graph structure</a>, with a set of core entities and properties defined by an ontology.</p>
      <p>The ontology is a work in progress and <a href="https://github.com/NRGI/resource-projects-etl/blob/master/ontology/resource-projects-ontology.rdf">can be found here</a> (RDF). Detailed documentation is in the works.</p>
      <p>A couple of initial notes that might help you exploring the data.</p>
      <h2 id="namespaces-mapping">Namespaces &amp; mapping</h2>
      <p>Core properties are all in the <a href="http://resourceprojects.org/def/">http://resourceprojects.org/def/</a> namespace. We use the prefix rp for this.</p>
      <p>If we encounter properties in incoming files that are not declared in our ontology we mint URIs for these under <a href="http://resourceprojects.org/def/misc/">http://resourceprojects.org/def/misc/</a> in order to keep track of them, and consider them for inclusion in the full ontology later. We use the prefix rp_misc for this.</p>
      <p>We have tried to use pattern from existing ontologies where possible, but have not yet systematically mapped relationships to these.</p>
      <h3 id="stakeholding-memberships">Stakeholding &amp; memberships</h3>
      <p>One of the common modelling issues we need to deal with in resource projects data is the association between a company and a project, or between companies and groups.</p>
      <p>Because these are subject to change over time, we model the relationship with an intermediate entity, either a rp:Stake, or rp:Membership.</p>
      <p>Properties subject to change over time, such as percentage share, or status as operator of a project, attach to the Stake, rather than the company or project directly.</p>
      <h4 id="stakeholding-relationships">Stakeholding relationships</h4>
      <p>The relationship between a project and company via Stake looks as follows:</p>

      <img src="/img/model-stakes.png" alt="Project, Companies and Stakes model" /><p class="caption">Project, Companies and Stakes model</p>
      </div>
      <p>rp:stakeholder and rp:stakeholding are transitive parent classes. Reasoning will be needed to enabled to query using these.</p>
